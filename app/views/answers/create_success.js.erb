<%# j is a helper method from Rails to escape the Javascript so it doensn't
    break because of the quotes and new lines characters %>
$('.answers').prepend("<%= j render 'answer', answer: @answer %>");

<%# we will need to reset @answer to be 'ANswer.new' because @answer is now
persisted and this will make the form submit an update request instead of a
create request. %>
<% @answer = Answer.new %>
$("#answer-form").html("<%= j render 'form' %>")
