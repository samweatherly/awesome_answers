<%# dom_id helper method takes in an active record model and generates an id
that can be used on the page which helps identify this div uniquely. It will
use snake case name of the model and then it will add the id of the record you
passwed prepended by _. For example, if you pass it 'Answer' object with id 5,
it will generate 'answer_5' %>
<div id="<%= dom_id(answer) %>">
<%= answer.body %> (by: <%= answer.user_full_name %>)
<% if can? :destroy, answer %>
  <%= link_to "Delete", question_answer_path(@question, answer),
                      method: :delete,
                      remote: true,
                      data: {confirm: "Are you sure?"} %>
<% end %>
