    # We define an abliity using the 'can' method that comes from 'cancancan'
    # :manage allows any actino on the model (in this case Quesiton)
    # for example: :edit, :destroy, :update ... etc
    # This doesn't enforce the rule, we just define the rule in here.

    #
    # The first argument to `can` is the action you are giving the user
    # permission to do.
    # If you pass :manage it will apply to every action. Other common actions
    # here are :read, :create, :update and :destroy.
    #
    # The second argument is the resource the user can perform the action on.
    # If you pass :all it will apply to every resource. Otherwise pass a Ruby
    # class of the resource.
    #
    # The third argument is an optional hash of conditions to further filter the
    # objects.
    # For example, here the user can only update published articles.
    #
    #   can :update, Article, :published => true
